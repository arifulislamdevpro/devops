Composer (version 2.2.9) successfully installed to: /usr/local/bin/composer
Use it: php /usr/local/bin/composer

composer

âœ… But ideally, make composer available globally:
If you want to run just composer from anywhere instead of the long command, do this:
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer
Then test it with:

composer --version
You should see something like:

Composer version 2.2.9 2022-03-15 22:13:37


sudo rm /usr/local/bin/composer
rm ~/composer-setup.php
composer --version
